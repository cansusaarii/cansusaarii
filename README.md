## Hi there 👋 I'm Cansu,

I am a senior student at Boğaziçi University, Department of Computer Science and Educational Technology. I am currently developing myself in the fields of data science and artificial intelligence. I also have projects in the field of game development. The most important thing that motivates me is to constantly work on something that makes me curious and broadens my perspective.

👨‍💻I have taken some trainings from different courses about Python, SQL, Tableau and I continue to improve myself by taking part in different projects.

💪I value the principle of lifelong learning.

🌱I love discovering new places and learning new languages. I am currently learning German.
